        <p className="white-text p-tag">
        My technical toolkit includes Matlab, JavaScript, Python, and C/C++, with expertise in Human-AI Interaction, Computer Graphics and Control Algorithms. I have received the 2023 Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship at Purdue and have worked in institutions like Boston University and KAIST in the past.
        At MLSS and then AISC, I have also spent time studying ways to improve safety in AI systems.
        </p><p className="white-text p-tag">
        Beyond academics, I'm passionate about solving and creating puzzles, exploring Linux, and website scraping. Philosophy deeply interests me, particularly works by Camus, Dostoevsky, and Hesse. I highly recommend checking out 80000 hours career advice, which helped shape my perspective on creating meaningful impact.

        When I am not in front of my screen, I like to try new vegetarian recipies and enjoy taking long walks with my partner.
        </p><p className="white-text p-tag">
        I also enjoy mentoring, having served as a PROMYS counselor and Learning Assistant for Calc-3 at my Academic Resource Center. I continue to give back by grading for PROMYS (for 3 years now) and working as a TIA at Impact Academy, both communities where I'm an alumnus.
